# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to create a data table that shows the differences between the three established city types and the fares for the rides provided. We are also tasked with creating a visual to display those weekly differences over a four month period, January 2019 through April 2019. 

## Results

Looking at the total rides by city we find that the urban cities have the largest number of rides, that is understandable given the greater population density. With the total drivers we see again that urban has the largest number however when compared to the number of rides given we see that there are more drivers than number of rides needed. This means taht wee have plenty of drivers to meet the demand for rides, however we should continue to track this trend as drivers not having rides to give could lead to driver turn over. The total fares collect shows a similar story with rural cities being the lowest and urban being the highest.

By averaging the fares by ride we establish a base level of income by ride, we see a shift however with rural rides costing more than suburban and urban. If we pulled the length of rides we should see a correlation with rural rides being longer. Looking at the average fare earned by driver we see a large disparity between rual and urban with rural drivers earning over three times as urban drivers. This is a product of the factors brought up earlier assumed longer routes and fewer drivers meaning they can pick up multiple rides in a period.

Here we can see the weekly fares compared to each other. Rural cities are a small portion of the revenue stream could be possible to make increases there. 

## Summary

Looking at the number of drivers compared to rides we see an opportunity in suburban and rural cities. In an effort to increase the numbers of drivers we have in suburban and rural cities we need to start a recruitment campaign.

Being the lowest city sector we have, rural cities could be increased. With the assumption we made about the correlation between the higher fares and length of those rides we see a way to increase sales. By creating a promotional campaign to entice more riders we could offer either a flat discount or a discount for rides over a certain length.

While the large number of drivers over rides needed for urban cities ensures that we have plenty drivers available. We see that this could arise as a problem with drivers leaving the company because they are not getting enough fares. Urban cities have the lowest average fare so we think an increase in pricing could help support the drivers and retain them while increasing revenuw overall.
